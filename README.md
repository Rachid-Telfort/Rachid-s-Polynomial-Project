# Rachid-s-Polynomial-Project
About
	This project was one of three main projects that was assigned to me in my data structures class while I was attending Georgetown University. This project consisted on implementing various operations on polynomials such as addition, subtraction, and exponent. After the course ended I decided to revisit this project again since I had a difficult time implementing it while taking data structures. When I revisited it, I decided to challenge myself by adding more functions such as square root and division. This project took me about two months to finish due to testing and debugging. The project’s original creator is Bala Kayalansundaram, a professor at the Computer Science department of Georgetown University.
  
Execution File Use
	The execution file is menu driven. When one first opens it up they will be greeted by a menu prompt by asking them to choose the type of working polynomial they want to start the program with (One can always manipulate the polynomial after going through the prompt). You select the polynomial that you’re starting with by choosing the appropriate number and pressing enter (This is just in case the instructions are unclear). After the user gets through the first prompt, they will be greeted by a second menu prompt showing the various options that the user has when it comes to manipulating the working polynomial (This menu prompt will be re-displayed after a menu choice is processed). Just like the first menu prompt, when you enter a choice by its number you press enter to execute the next step of instructions that is activated by the choice being selected. Then the next step of instructions per menu choice are processed by pressing enter after inputting your desired input pertaining to the instruction. I understand that these are very basic instructions on how to use the execution file. If one would like more clarification or has suggestions, please comment on the project page on GitHub or email me at rachidtelfort@gmail.com.

Final Notes
	I hope that my fellow coders will find the source code helpful as well as gain valuable insight from it. If you have read this, thank you for looking at my GitHub page it is much appreciated.
